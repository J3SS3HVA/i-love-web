**Building a good wrapper**

- old

```css
max-width: 75rem;
margin: 0 auto;
padding: 0 1.5rem;
```

- new

```css
margin-inline: min(100% - 3rem, 75rem) auto;
```

**why using a wrapper**

answer: Cause developers say whing like we need to use 12 grid collumns.


Things about designing a page: We used *adobe ps* to create our pages but it became outdated and was a bit complex for something simple. Thats when figma comes in to play. a good example shows how you can create a box shadow between the 2 programs.
